Outcome Demonstration: https://youtu.be/GkV1hRT9QNs

Project Idea:

In this project, participants engage in a simulated telephone booking system. By referencing the use of 'time fitter' strategies to extend waiting times and delay processes, participants attempt to secure a GP appointment. The project integrates elements of probability, bidding, and scenario-based challenges to create a gamified perspective of the GP appointment system, highlighting the inefficiencies and emotional frustration experienced by patients during the booking process.


Objectives:

•	Develop a computational tool/system that illustrates the emotional experience and journey patients must endure in the process of seeking basic healthcare

•	Explore the social and political implications of fairness and hierarchy within healthcare management systems

•	Highlight the issues within the healthcare management system

•	Explore the implications of queueing and waiting for hospital treatment/primary care



Relevant Questions:

•	Does our city’s infrastructure meet the basic needs of our community?

•	How do queueing systems and long waiting times impact the experience of receiving healthcare in the UK?

•	What factors may influence the success rate for booking a GP appointment?

•	Why does the GP appointment booking system feel competitive?

•	Do we really need to justify ourselves to receive the help and treatment we need?
